features:
  - |
    The apt repository setup for the galera_server role is migrated to use
    the deb822_repository ansible module rather than the legacy apt_key and
    apt_repository modules. The format of the `galera_repo` role default
    variable is changed to match the requirements of the new module, and
    is now a list to allow multiple repositories to be configured if required.
upgrade:
  - |
    The configuration of apt repositories for the galera_server role through
    the `galera_repo` variable is changed to match the deb822_repository
    ansible module. Any deployments that customise the galera_server repository
    configuration should adjust their `galera_repo` override to suit.
