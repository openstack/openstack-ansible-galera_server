    Default value of ``galera_wsrep_address`` has changed from
    ``ansible_host``, which could vary based on the deployment scenario,
    to ``management_address``, which will be set to the IP of the
    management network.
    The fallback to ``ansible_host`` is present to avoid failures when
    ``management_address`` is not defined.
